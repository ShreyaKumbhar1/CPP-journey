This folder contains my C++ basics practice programs, created while learning the core fundamentals of the C++ programming language 💻🚀. 
The programs here cover essential topics like basic program structure, input and output using `cin` and `cout`, variables and data types, operators, 
conditional statements, loops, and simple problem-solving exercises 🧠✨. 
The goal of this folder is to build a strong foundation in C++ and improve logical thinking before moving on to advanced topics such as 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) 📚🔥. 
This folder represents the beginning of my C++ learning journey, focusing on practice, clarity, and consistent improvement 🌱.
